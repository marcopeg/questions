# `src/layouts`

Layouts are React components that are supposed to render a decorative piece of the UI who's main responsibility is to render a View.

These kind of components may grow quite comples for the decorative responsibilites may involve menus and similar stuff.

They are usually also _containers_ meaning that is next-to-impossible to create a complex Layout without the need to access the State of the App.
